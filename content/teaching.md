## Data Bootcamp

Working with Dave Backus and Chase Coleman, I helped create the Data Bootcamp
course at NYU stern and taught it for multiple semesters. The class is aimed at
advanced undergraduates or MBA students who have no programming experience. The
goal is to teach them the basics of Python and its data-handling tools and
prepare them to gather/clean/explore/visualize real-world data. See our [sales
pitch](http://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/fall2016/faq/) for more info.

As of right now (2017-06-08) all materials are online and available on GitHub.
Some of the main things we created along the way are [a
book](https://nyudatabootcamp.gitbooks.io/data-bootcamp/content/),
[assignments](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/tree/master/Documents),
[jupyter
notebooks](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/tree/master/Code/notebooks),
and a collection of [student
projects](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Projects) that demonstrate what
students are able to do after completing the course. All information about the
class can be found on our [website](http://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/fall2016/)
