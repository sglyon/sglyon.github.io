Welcome to my website! I am a member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng) (sometimes people say I'm a
[Mormon](http://www.mormon.org/)). I have a beautiful wife and three awesome
children. I am a PhD student in the
[Economics](http://econ.as.nyu.edu/page/home) department in the [New York
University Stern School of Business](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/).

In addition to church, family, and school; I am also interested in sports, food,
and programming. I'm fairly active in the Julia community and also (occasionaly) contribute to the SciPy ecosystem.

You can find most of my work on [GitHub](http://github.com/spencerlyon2).
