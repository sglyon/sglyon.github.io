I live in NYC with my beautiful wife and three awesome kids.

I'm a PhD student in the [Economics](http://econ.as.nyu.edu/page/home)
department in the [New York University Stern School of
Business](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/).

I am a member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng) (also known as [Mormon](http://www.mormon.org/)).

In addition to family, school, and religion; I am also interested in sports,
food, and programming. I'm fairly active in the [Julia](https://julialang.org)
community and also (occasionally) contribute to the
[SciPy/PyData](https://pydata.org) ecosystem.

You can find most of my published or open source work on
[GitHub](http://github.com/sglyon).

Some of the projects I've built or worked on include:

- The [NYU data bootcamp](https://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/fall2016/) course (see [the teaching page]({{< relref "teaching.md" >}}))
