In models with recursive preferences, endogenous variation in Pareto weights
would be interpreted as wedges from the perspective of a frictionless model
with additive preferences. We describe the behavior of the (relative) Pareto
weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and
the real exchange rate.

Should a nation's tax system become more progressive as it opens to trade? Does
opening to trade change the benefits of a progressive tax system? We answer
these question within a standard incomplete markets model with frictional labor
markets and Ricardian trade. Consistent with empirical evidence, adverse shocks
to comparative advantage lead to labor income loses for
import-competition-exposed workers; with incomplete markets, these workers are
imperfectly insured and experience welfare losses. A progressive tax system is
valuable as it substitutes for imperfect insurance and redistributes the gains
from trade. However, it also reduces the incentives to work and for labor to
reallocate away from comparatively disadvantaged locations. We find that
progressivity should increase with openness to trade and that progressivity is
an important tool to mitigate the negative consequences of globalization.
