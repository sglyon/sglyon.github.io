[Pareto Weights as Wedges in Two-Country Models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188916300501)
: with [Dave Backus], [Chase Coleman], and [Axelle Ferriere] -- JEDC April 2016

> In models with recursive preferences, endogenous variation in Pareto weights would be interpreted as wedges from the perspective of a frictionless model with additive preferences. We describe the behavior of the (relative) Pareto weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and the real exchange rate.

[Redistributing the Gains From Trade through Progressive Taxation](/files/LW_tax.pdf)
: with [Michael Waugh]

[Slides](/files/LW_nber.pdf)

> This paper studies the optimal degree of tax progressivity as an economy opens
> to trade. We answer this question within a standard incomplete markets model
> with frictional labor markets and Ricardian trade. Labor market frictions lead
> to losses in labor income and reductions in labor force participation for
> import-competition-exposed workers. In an incomplete markets setting, adverse
> shocks to comparative advantage are imperfectly insured and
> import-competition-exposed workers experience welfare losses. A progressive tax
> system transfers resources to the losers from trade and substitutes for
> imperfect insurance. However, a progressive tax system reduces incentives to
> work and for labor to reallocate from comparatively disadvantaged locations to
> locations with a comparative advantage. We calibrate the model to match the
> observed labor market response to trade exposure and solve for the optimal
> degree of progressivity of the tax system with varying levels of exposure to
> trade.
