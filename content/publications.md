[Pareto Weights as Wedges in Two-Country Models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188916300501)
: with [Dave Backus], [Chase Coleman], and [Axelle Ferriere] -- JEDC April 2016

> In models with recursive preferences, endogenous variation in Pareto weights would be interpreted as wedges from the perspective of a frictionless model with additive preferences. We describe the behavior of the (relative) Pareto weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and the real exchange rate.
